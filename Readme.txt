Game design:
There are 3 pages in this othello game.

The 1st page is the starting page. In the first page, users can input their names, so in the game they can see the scoreboard show their name and scorepoints. A start button is also in this page to slip to the second page.

The second page is the game page, in which the users can play othello with each other. Three buttons are designed in this page, which can help the user to start a newgame, retract or see the hints.

When the game meets an end, it will jump to the third page, which is a congratulation page showing the winner.

My UI design has a special NBA style, which use team logos as chess and the final champion rings as the hints.

Implementation:
Start game,  newgame, retract, show hints.
Input username, background music and congratulation are extra functions. 

limitation:
No AI is designed.
